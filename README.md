# AWS IoT Core WebSockets support for Go (Golang)

Connecting to AWS IoT Core with certificates is great. But sometimes you just want to use WebSockets with your AWS
credentials. This library makes it easy to do that.

## This is not my code originally!

[This code was posted in a GitHub issue years ago](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/2485#issuecomment-469366846).
I created a similar library for Java when I was working at AWS and I wanted to do the same for Go.
